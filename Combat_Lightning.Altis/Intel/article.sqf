		["text","The main base I was stationed at while embedded with US forces was quiet, except for the occasional roar of helicopters, but this will undoubtedly change once the main attack is begun by allied forces. The men are in good spirits, according to Corporal Kelly Smith, member of Alpha Squad, 'they will not know what hit them, we will ram them like a freight train.' This is an example of US superiourity in this region, winning hearts and minds by helping locals and dealing with the many legacies of this nation that has seen far too much war."],

		["text","The US forces are aiming to push back against the insurgent invasion and push back the main invasion force to the main airport and destroy their infrastructure. They are also focusing on interception of enemy reinforcements and patrols on the way to the enemy headquarters."],
		
		["text","The main aim of this mission is to destroy enemy installations, whilst avoiding civilian casualties. This is very important. The civilians are on our side, but we must keep it that way. Judge what is actually required to destroy an installation, and minimize collateral damages. Once all installations near the base have been destroyed, move across country and push the enemy forces back towards their main base. If they are contained there, they will be easily overcome. Use of Raven UAV and other air assets for spotting enemy movements will be a very powerful tool for defeating the enemy forces."],

		["text","Once the enemy are contained, we could setup a front line and hold them there. This will be better than constantly having to find their reinforcements as they are en-route."],
